## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **int** | Unique ID for this entity. Not to be confused with the Integration ID, which is set by your integration layer and used in most endpoints. | 
**created** | [**\DateTime**](\DateTime.md) | The exact moment this entity was created. | 
**title** | **string** | The human-friendly display name for this event type. Use a short, past-tense, description of the event. | 
**name** | **string** | The machine-friendly canonical name for this event type. This will be used in URLs, and cannot be changed after an event type has been created. | 
**description** | **string** | An explanation of when the event type is triggered. Write this with a campaign manager in mind. For example:  &gt; The \&quot;Payment Accepted\&quot; event is triggered after successful processing of a payment by our payment gateway. | [optional]
